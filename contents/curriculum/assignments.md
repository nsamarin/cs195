# Assignment 1: Conducting a User Study for a Mobile App
Imagine that you are hired as a consultant by a non-profit app development company. They ask you to consider the following problem statement:

Participating in a protest or a social movement allows an individual to exercise their right to free speech, but carries risks with respect to their personal and legal safety. Online technologies enable both greater cooperation and communication between activists as well as elevated risks of surveillance by law enforcement and other malicious actors. We are considering developing a mobile application that would allow users to safely organize and participate in protests and social movements. However, we would like to evaluate the limitations of existing solutions, perceptions of relevant stakeholders, and considerations for implementing the requested features before going ahead with the application development.

As part of your assignment, you will research existing solutions and conduct at least two interviews to help you answer the following questions:

- What technological solutions (e.g., apps, websites, services, social networks, etc.) are currently used to organize and participate in protests?
- What issues exist with the current solutions?
- What are the concerns and needs of the prospective users of the application?
- What features should the proposed application support?
- Which factors should the company consider when implementing those features? 

You will be paired with a partner to complete this assignment. Here is the list of deliverables that you need to submit by the due date:
Your final report (expected length of around 1000 words, double-spaced, PDF). Please address the above questions in your final report.
The interview guide.
Any notes or recordings from the interviews (at least two) that you used in preparing your report.
